# nomo.utils (development version)

* Updated `generate_coefs` function to use the `concordance` function from the **survival** package rather than using the **Hmisc** package as the `concordance` function is faster when working with large datasets. Removed **Hmisc** as a dependency.

* Updated `push_final_results` to have a "source_subdir" option.

* Updated `generate_pred` function to allow user to specify names for the returned linear predictor and predicted event and survival probabilities.

* Updated packages and code for `generate_pred` so that this function works with updated **rlang** package.

* Updated help file for `generate_pred` function to specify what variables are generated by this function.

* Updated `generate_pred` function to generate predictions and give a warning when a coefficient value provided to the function is `NA`.

# nomo.utils 0.1.0

* First release
